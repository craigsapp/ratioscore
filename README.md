ratioscore
===========

Ratioscore is a program to convert a [Humdrum](https://www.humdrum.org)-based textual
score representing musical intervals as ratios into a MIDI file to listen to the score,
primarily for listening to just intervals through a standard, simple MIDI playback device
through the use of pitchbend messsages to alter the standard equal-temperament tuning.
The website https://ratioscore.humdrum.org is an online interface to this software for online
MIDI/MP3 conversions and online listening, as well as documentation for creating Ratioscores.
